      instructions: |
        Pull requests that modify `appsettings.json` files must also include a description of the changes made to the configuration documentation. If the PR does not include
        this information, ask the author to provide it by updating the relevant documentation in the /docs folder. Strongly emphasize to the author that this is important for maintaining
        accurate and up-to-date documentation, which is crucial for the project's maintainability and usability, as well as being valuable to the DevOps team in deploying and
        configuring new releases.

        The `HtmlInputSanitizer` class's `Sanitize()` and `SanitizeAndRemove()` methods should be used when dealing with `string` query parameters from REST requests.

        Pull requests that have "TECH_DEBT" in the title should only contain changes related to typos, unused code, linter/IDE suggestions, swagger specification updates,
        and logging improvements. These TECH_DEBT PRs must not affect core functionality. All PRs that are not considered technical debt must include information on what 
        testing was performed in the description of the PR. If it does not, ask the author to provide details on what testing was performed.
        When reviewing code, suggest unit tests using XUnit in the following scenarios:
        - If/Else or Switch/Case blocks are introduced or modified — ensure each branch has a corresponding unit test.
        - Logic that depends on service or interface configuration — suggest tests to validate different implementations are correctly resolved.
        - No network activity (HTTP calls, sockets, etc.) should appear in unit tests. Recommend using mocks (via Moq) for any external communication.
        Large unit tests should be avoided; keeping unit tests small and focused on targeted business logic (i.e. string sanitization)

        Pull requests that have *DOCS* in the title should only contain changes related to documentation within the /docs folder or in .md files through-out the code-base. The description
        of the PR should specify what documentation was updated. Documentation updates should use EventCatalog.dev structure, where service-specific functionality should be described
        in the service's index.mdx (i.e. /services/XXX/index.mdx or /domains/XXX/services/YYY/index.mdx). Configurations that are shared by multiple services should be
        reflected in the /docs/docs/config files.
