## Overview

* **Tenant Configuration & Management**: Administrators can configure and manage tenant-level settings, including operational parameters, identifiers, and environment-specific options—enabling scalable multi-tenant deployments.
* **User Management**: Allows for full lifecycle management of users within each tenant context, including user creation, role assignment, account activation/deactivation, and permission updates.
* **Integration Testing Support**: Offers tools to initiate and track integration tests, enabling administrators to validate service connectivity and workflow correctness within tenant environments.
* **Viewing Report Metadata**: Users can browse report records, view detailed metadata (e.g. status, timestamps, versions), and audit submission history within the system.
* **Report Downloading**: Enables secure download of generated report packages for manual delivery, archival, or verification—retrieved via AdminBFF endpoints.

### Authentication

The Admin UI supports authentication using:

* OAuth2 via an identity provider (e.g., Azure AD, Keycloak), enabling secure login with centralized identity and access management.
* Token Generation via AdminBFF /api/login, which provides session tokens for downstream API access when deployed in a simplified or standalone context.
