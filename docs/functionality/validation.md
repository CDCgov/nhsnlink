# Validation Service Documentation

## Overview
The **Validation Service** is a component responsible for validating FHIR resources associated with a patient 
after the Measure Evaluation process is complete. It ensures that resources conform to both the core FHIR 
specification and specific StructureDefinitions (profiles) as asserted in the `meta.profile` property of 
each resource.

## Process Flow
1. **Measure Evaluation Completion**
    - The Measure Evaluation Service evaluates a patient.
    - Once evaluation is complete, it produces a Kafka `ResourceEvaluated` message for each resource returned by measure evaluation (including the MeasureReport).

2. **Report Services Persists MeasureReport**
    - The report service consumes `ResourceEvaluated` and persists the resources.
    - When the `MeasureReport` is processed by the Report service, it uses that to determine when it has received and persisted *all* resources.
    - After all resources are persisted, the status of the patient for the submission changes to `ReadyToValidate`.
    - After the status of the patient's submission changes, it produces a `ReadyForValidation` event.

3. **Validation Service Consumption**
    - The Validation Service consumes the Kafka `ReadyForValidation` event.
    - It retrieves the **MeasureReport** for the specified patient from the Report Service.
    - It extracts all contained FHIR resources and constructs a **Bundle** for validation.

4. **Validation Execution**
    - Each resource in the bundle is validated individually.
    - The validation process includes:
        - **FHIR Core Specification Validation**: Ensures compliance with the base FHIR standard.
        - **Profile Validation**: Each resource is checked against the profiles asserted in `meta.profile`.
            - If a required **StructureDefinition** (profile) is missing, a **warning** is generated:  
              *"Can't find profile http://.../us-core-observation"*
        - **ValueSet and CodeSystem Validation**: Ensures that coded elements conform to the expected ValueSets and CodeSystems.
            - If a required **ValueSet** or **CodeSystem** is missing, a **warning** is generated:  
              *"Can't find value set XXX"*
    - All validation results are aggregated into a single **OperationOutcome**, capturing any validation issues.
    - The **OperationOutcome** containing all validation issues is stored for further processing or review.
    - The categorization process is initiated against the validation issues found, and each issue is matched (if possible) to a category.
    - Categorized results are persisted in the database.
    - The validation service produces a `ValidationComplete` Kafka event and includes an indication of whether the patient's submission is valid.

## Configuration

The Validation Service supports two types of artifacts that define validation rules:

1. **Package (`package.tgz` format)**
    - A packaged collection of FHIR artifacts (profiles, ValueSets, CodeSystems).

2. **FHIR Resource Artifacts**
    - Individual **StructureDefinitions**, **ValueSets**, and **CodeSystems** can be provided.

In addition to artifacts, categories must be initialized/specified in order to have categorized results. Otherwise, all validation results end up being "uncategorized".

Categories can be configured individually or in bulk.

## Example: Profile Validation

When the validation service encounters an Observation resource like the following:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Observation",
  "meta": {
    "profile": ["http://.../us-core-observation"]
  },
  "... other properties"
}
```

It will:

* Validate the resource against the core FHIR specification.
* Validate against the http://.../us-core-observation profile.
* If the profile is missing, generate a warning.

Similarly, for properties bound to a ValueSet or CodeSystem, the service expects these artifacts to be provided. If they are missing, it will issue warnings.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the Measure Evaluation Service, Kafka, and the Validation Service:
