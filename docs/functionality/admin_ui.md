# Administrative UI Documentation

## Overview

The **Administrative UI** is a central component of the system designed to provide a back-office portal for maintaining and managing an installation. It consists of two key components:

1. **Front-End Angular Application**: The user-facing interface for administrators.
2. **Back-End REST API (BFF)**: The supporting API responsible for authentication, session management, and request routing.

## Key Features

### Architecture

- The **BFF**:
    - Enforces authentication using OAuth.
    - Tracks user sessions via cookies.
    - Acts as a gateway to the underlying microservices by proxying requests and managing access.

- Deployment Structure:
    - Both the Angular UI and the BFF are (or should be) deployed to the same endpoint.
    - `/`: Serves the Angular front-end application.
    - `/api`: Serves the BFF REST API.

### Functionality

The Admin UI provides functionality to:

- **Tenant Configuration**: Manage settings and preferences for individual tenants.
- **Account/Access Management**: Oversee user accounts, roles, and permissions.
- **Operations**: Invoke operations necessary for testing and debugging the installation.
- **Report Status Monitoring**: View the progress and outcomes of reports being generated by the system.
- **System and Audit Logs**: Review logs for system operations and audit trails.

### Security and Access

- The **Angular UI** and **BFF** are the only components exposed publicly to ensure minimal surface exposure.
- All microservices require authentication; however, the **BFF** acts as the primary gatekeeper by:
    - Proxying external requests to the appropriate underlying microservices.
    - Managing and limiting access to the internal infrastructure.

This design ensures that the underlying microservices remain secure and inaccessible from direct external requests.
