## Summary

A REST operation implemented by the Terminology service that validates a code against a code system using 
terminology artifacts loaded in memory to support high performance.

The validation code operation complies with the FHIR 
<a href="https://build.fhir.org/codesystem-operation-validate-code.html" target="_blank">Operation $validate-code on CodeSystem</a> specification.

The implementation of this operation is almost identical to the $validate-code operation on ValueSet. The "system" 
parameter is not required, in this case, because the code system is explicitly identified in the URL.

### Example Requests

**Using query parameters with the CodeSystem identified in the path of the URL**

```
POST {{terminology-api-base}}/api/terminology/fhir/CodeSystem/address-type/$validate-code?code=physical
```

**Using query parameters**

> Note: The "url" query parameter often has special characters that must be URL-encoded, as in this example.

```
POST {{terminology-api-base}}/api/terminology/fhir/CodeSystem/$validate-code?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhl7.org%2Ffhir%2Faddress-type&code=physical
```
