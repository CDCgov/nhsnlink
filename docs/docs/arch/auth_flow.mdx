title: Auth Flow
summary: Describes the various authentication flows supported by the system
---

The Link Admin BFF (Backend for Frontend) implements a secure authentication flow using OAuth 2.0 with cookie-based session management. This provides a robust security model where the BFF acts as the OAuth client and manages user sessions through secure HTTP-only cookies.

# Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Login Request**

* The UI redirects users to `/api/login` on the BFF
* The BFF initiates the authorization by redirecting to the configured Identity Provider (IdP) or Authorization Server
* The OAuth provider authenticates the user and returns an authorization code

2. **Token Exchange & Session Creation**

* The BFF exchanges the authorization code for access/refresh tokens
* The BFF creates a session and issues a secure HTTP-only cookie named "link_cookie"
* The cookie contains session information but not the actual OAuth tokens
* OAuth tokens are securely stored server-side and managed by the BFF

3. **Subsequent Requests**

* The UI includes the session cookie automatically with each request
* The BFF validates the cookie and retrieves the associated session
* The BFF uses the OAuth tokens to make authenticated requests to backend services
* Token refresh is handled transparently by the BFF when needed
* The BFF generates a short lived JWT token and adds it to the Authorization header when making requests to backend services

# Cookie Security

* Cookies are HTTP-only to prevent XSS attacks
* Secure flag ensures cookies only sent over HTTPS
* Anti-forgery protection enabled
* Session cookies with server-side storage

# Token Security

* OAuth tokens never exposed to the frontend
* Tokens stored securely server-side
* Token refresh handled by BFF
* Short-lived access tokens with automatic refresh

# CORS Protection

* Strict CORS policy configured
* Credentials mode enabled for cookie transmission
* Only trusted origins allowed

# PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

PKCE is implemented to secure the OAuth authorization code flow and prevent authorization code interception attacks:

**Code Verifier Generation**

* A cryptographically random code verifier is generated for each authentication request
* The verifier is stored securely server-side in the BFF
* Length and character requirements follow OAuth PKCE specifications

**Code Challenge**

* The code challenge is derived from the verifier using SHA-256
* Challenge is included in the initial authorization request
* The challenge method is set to "S256" (SHA-256)

**Code Exchange**

* Original code verifier is included when exchanging the authorization code
* OAuth provider validates the code challenge/verifier pair
* Prevents malicious actors from using intercepted auth codes

# State Parameter Protection

The state parameter provides CSRF protection during the OAuth flow:

**State Generation**

* Cryptographically secure random state value generated per request
* State is bound to the user's session
* Stored server-side in the BFF

**State Validation**

* State parameter included in authorization request
* Returned state must match the original stored value
* Requests with invalid/missing state are rejected
* Protects against CSRF and replay attacks

# Scope Restrictions

OAuth scopes are strictly controlled to limit access:

**Required Scopes**

openid profile email

**Scope Validation**

* Only pre-configured scopes are allowed
* Scope requests are validated against allowed list
* Additional scopes require explicit configuration
* Prevents scope elevation attacks

**Scope Usage**

* Scopes map to specific API permissions
* Access tokens only receive approved scopes
* Resource access is restricted by granted scopes

# Configuration

The BFF's OAuth and cookie settings are configured in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"Authentication": {
  "DefaultScheme": "link_cookie",
  "DefaultChallengeScheme": "link_oauth2",
  "Schemas": {
    "Cookie": {
      "HttpOnly": true,
      "Domain": "",
      "Path": "/"
    },
    "Oauth2": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "ClientId": "",
      "ClientSecret": "",
      "Endpoints": {
        "Authorization": "",
        "Token": "",
        "UserInformation": ""
      },
      "CallbackPath": "/api/signin-oauth2"
    }
  }
}
```

# UI Integration

The UI application interacts with the BFF's authentication system through:

## Login

```javascript
// Redirect to BFF login endpoint
window.location.href = '/api/login';
```

## Session Status

```javascript
// Check if user is authenticated
fetch('/api/user', {
credentials: 'include' // Important for cookie transmission
});
```

## Logout

```javascript
// Redirect to BFF logout endpoint
    window.location.href = '/api/logout';
```

The UI never directly handles OAuth tokens or credentials - all authentication is delegated to and managed by the BFF or a designated identity provider such as Azure or Keycloak.
