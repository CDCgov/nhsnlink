## Overview

The terminology service is responsible for storing all terminology used by the system; specifically the Measure 
Evaluation Service and the Validation Service. It maintains the terminology in memory so that it may respond as quickly 
as possible to requests to expand value sets and validate codes. It does not have logic to dynamically expand value sets
and relies on other systems to determine the enumerated codes that belong to each value set and code system.
