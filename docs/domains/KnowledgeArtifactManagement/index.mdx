## Overview

The Knowledge Artifact Management domain represents the organizational and governance processes that support and surround the technical domains within the Link ecosystem.

This domain includes key artifacts such as:

* FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs), including FHIR Profiles
* Digital Quality Measures (dQMs)
* Terminology Resources (CodeSystems, ValueSets, etc.)

These assets serve as foundational specifications that guide behavior, structure, and expectations across domains like Reporting, Data Ingestion, and Evaluation.

Rather than owning executable services, this domain captures the processes, standards alignment, and content lifecycle required to ensure consistency and reusability across the system.

## Requirements

Roles:

* Knowledge Artifact Administrator
* System Administrator
* Developer
* Quality Assurance Tester

### Stakeholder Requirements

| Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Category               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| As a knowledge artifact administrator (specialization of systems admin), I can manage persistence, access, relationship and other characteristics of knowledge artifacts so that dependent functionality operates appropriately. | Process                |
| As a knowledge artifact administrator, I can see what dependencies are missing for a loaded IG, so that I may find and load them and not have evaluation and/or validation fail at runtime.                                      | Process                |
| As a system administrator, I want to load FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) that include Measures, Profiles, and Terminology artifacts, so that the platform can support standards-based evaluation and validation.               | Process                |
| As a quality assurance tester, I want to manage multiple versions of the same IG, to support testing changes to implementation guides without impacting other tenants and users.                                                 | Version Management     |
| As a system administrator, I want to manage multiple versions of the same IG, to support incremental release of implementation guide updates across all tenants.                                                                 | Version Management     |

### System Requirements

| Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                          | Category               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| As the system, I want to register FHIR IG artifacts in a shared repository, so that multiple dependent services can access them.                                                                     | Process                |
| As the system, I want to retrieve version-specific Measure artifacts from the knowledge artifact repository, so that reporting requirements can be confirmed.                                        | Version Management     |
| As the system, I want to access profile definitions from the loaded IGs, so that I can validate resource instances accurately.                                                                       | Process                |
| As the system, I want to load and reference ValueSet and CodeSystem definitions from IGs, so that I can confirm inform other services on the terminology needed to accurately evaluate and validate. | Process                |
| As the system, I want to store IG version metadata and associate it with report evaluation records, so that report reconstruction uses the correct logic.                                            | Report Reproducibility |
| As the system, I want to ensure IG updates do not overwrite previously loaded versions, so that all versions remain available for historical processing.                                             | Version Management     |
