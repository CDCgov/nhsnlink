## Overview

The Knowledge Artifact Management domain represents the organizational and governance processes that support and surround the technical domains within the Link ecosystem.

This domain includes key artifacts such as:

* FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs), including FHIR Profiles
* Digital Quality Measures (dQMs)
* Terminology Resources (CodeSystems, ValueSets, etc.)

These assets serve as foundational specifications that guide behavior, structure, and expectations across domains like Reporting, Data Ingestion, and Evaluation.

Rather than owning executable services, this domain captures the processes, standards alignment, and content lifecycle required to ensure consistency and reusability across the system.
