## Overview

The Data Acquisition service is responsible for connecting and querying a tenant's endpoint for FHIR resources that are needed to evaluate patients for a measure. For Epic installations, Link Cloud is utilizing the Epic FHIR STU3 Patient List resource to inform which patients are currently admitted in the facility. While this is the current solution to acquiring the patient census, there are other means of patient acquisition being investigated (ADT V2, Bulk FHIR) to provide universal support across multiple EHR vendors.

## Features and Functionality

**Data Acquisition** is a crucial step in the report generation pipeline, responsible for obtaining clinical data from external systems, such as FHIR R4 endpoints within electronic health record (EHR) systems. By systematically acquiring and managing data, it ensures that downstream processes like evaluation and reporting are equipped with the necessary information.

### Key Roles of Data Acquisition

1. **Patient List Acquisition**:
 - Retrieves a FHIR List of patients from the EHR, if configured.
 - Serves as the initial step for identifying patients relevant to quality measure evaluations.

2. **Individual Patient Data Acquisition**:
 - Acquires detailed FHIR data for individual patients identified in the census.
 - Includes all essential data elements required for initial measure evaluations.

3. **Supplemental Data Acquisition**:
 - Retrieves additional data elements that may not be needed for initial evaluations but are desirable for complete submission and reporting.

### Where Data Acquisition Fits in the Pipeline

Data acquisition plays a role in three distinct stages of the report generation pipeline:

1. **Patient Identification**:
 - Acquiring a list of patients from the EHR to determine the cohort for evaluation.

2. **Initial Data Collection and Evaluation**:
 - Obtaining the primary dataset needed for evaluating quality measures.
 - Determines whether a patient qualifies for reporting based on initial measure criteria.

3. **Supplemental Data Collection**:
 - Acquiring additional, non-essential data to enrich the submission.
 - Completes the dataset for comprehensive evaluation and reporting.

### Progressive Querying

To optimize data acquisition, the system employs a technique called **Progressive Querying**.

During progressive querying, data is acquired in stages to meet the evaluation pipeline's needs. It flows between services via Kafka topics/events, starting from data acquisition to normalization, through initial evaluation to determine patient relevance, and back to acquire supplemental data, which is then normalized and re-evaluated.

This method minimizes the data retrieved from the EHR by acquiring only what is necessary at each stage of the pipeline:

1. **Initial Querying**:
 - Focuses on essential data needed to evaluate measures and determine patient inclusion.

2. **Supplemental Querying**:
 - Retrieves additional data elements after initial evaluations confirm patient relevance.

3. **Final Evaluation**:
 - Combines initial and supplemental data for comprehensive measure evaluation and reporting.

#### Benefits of Progressive Querying
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the volume of data retrieved from the EHR, optimizing system performance.
- **Precision**: Focuses on acquiring only data that is needed for specific stages in the pipeline.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale operations by limiting unnecessary data transfers.

### Bulk FHIR in Data Acquisition

**Bulk FHIR** is a mechanism under exploration for acquiring data efficiently. However, several limitations impact its general use in data acquisition workflows:

1. **Challenges with Bulk FHIR**:
 - Most implementations lack sufficient support for acquiring specific patient data.
 - Filtering returned data is often not robust enough.
 - To align with the goal of acquiring only necessary data, the system does not currently implement Bulk FHIR for general initial or supplemental data acquisition.

2. **Use Cases for Bulk FHIR**:
 - **Patient Census Identification**:
  - Bulk FHIR is a viable solution for identifying the "census of patients," analogous to using the FHIR "List" endpoint.
  - It can acquire "Patient" resources for a group of patients associated with a query, filter, or registry in the EHR.
  - This use case is limited to identifying patients of interest and does not address broader data acquisition.

### Configuration for Data Acquisition

Data acquisition is configurable per tenant, ensuring flexibility to accommodate diverse EHR systems and data requirements. Key configurable parameters include:

- **Base FHIR URL**:
  - For general data acquisition.
  - For FHIR List (patients of interest) retrieval.

- **Authentication Information**:
  - Such as client credentials (e.g., "client id").

- **Patient Census Retrieval**:
  - FHIR List "id" or Bulk FHIR "Group ID" used for identifying the patient cohort.

- **EHR Query Throttling/Limitations**:
  - Configurable settings to respect EHR query limitations (e.g., maximum queries per minute).

#### Configuring Query Plans

Types of query plans:

* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly
* Discharge

"Discharge" query plans are used when a patient is discharged from the hospital. This plan is triggered by a discharge event and is used to acquire data for the patient.

All other types of query plans are used to acquire data for patients who are currently in the hospital triggered by the end *date/time* of the scheduled report. The tenant's timezone is used for this so that if the reporting period ends at 12:59:59 PM, that represents 12:59:59 PM in the tenant's timezone, not UTC time.

All times are stored in UTC format. The tenant's time zone is configured with a valid value from [IANA](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).

#### Configuring Census and Data Sources

Data sources (where the FHIR server is located and how to authenticate) are configured via "Query Configs". There is currently no association between a query _plan_ and data source. Whenever data acquisition attempts to execute a query plan against a data source, it uses the FHIR server and authentication method specified by the "Query Config", for the specified facility/tenant.

TODO: Add details about how to authenticate against Epic, Cerner, Basic, and/or OAuth data sources.

#### Application Configuration

# Logging

The Logging configuration defines the logging levels for different parts of the application.

| Property                                | Description                         | Required | Default Value                   | Secret? |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|---------|
| Logging__LogLevel__Default              | Default log level                   | No       |                                 | No      |
| Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft.AspNetCore | Log level for asp net core logs     | No       |                                 | No      |
| Logging__LogLevel__System               | Level for system logs               | No       |                                 | No      |
