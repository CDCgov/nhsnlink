## Submission Overview

The Submission service is responsible for packaging a tenant's reporting content and submitting them to a configured destination. Currently, the service only writes the submission content to its local file store. The submission package for a reporting period includes the following files:

| File | Description | Multiple Files? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Aggregate | A [MeasureReport](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/measurereport.html) resource that contains references to each patient evaluation for a specific measure | Yes, one per measure | 
| Patient List | A [List](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/list.html) resource of all patients that were admitted into the facility during the reporting period | No |
| Device | A [Device](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html) resource that details the version of Link Cloud that was used | No |
| Organization | An [Organization](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/organization.html) resource for the submitting facility | No |
| Other Resources | A [Bundle](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html) resource that contains all of the shared resources (Location, Medication, etc) that are referenced in the patient Measure Reports | No |
| Patient | A [Bundle](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html) resource that contains the MeasureReports and related resources for a patient | Yes, one per evaluated patient |

An example of the submission package can be found at `\link-cloud\Submission Example`.
